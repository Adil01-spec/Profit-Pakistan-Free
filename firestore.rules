/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data and manages free usage limits.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/history/{recordId}: Stores analysis records, accessible only by the user.
 * - /free_usage/{userId}: Tracks free usage of report exports and AI prompts, accessible only with validation.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Anonymous users are supported via device-based IDs.
 * - Data consistency between paths and document fields is enforced on creation and updates.
 * - Free usage limits are strictly enforced to prevent bypass attempts.
