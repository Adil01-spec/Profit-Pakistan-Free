/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Profit Pakistan Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection and access control. It uses an ownership model where
 * users have full control over their own data. Public read access is enabled for "plans" collection.
 * No other data is publicly accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/history/{recordId}: Analysis records for a specific user, accessible only by that user.
 * - /free_usage/{userId}: Tracks free usage of features; accessible only by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - The rules explicitly deny any unauthorized access attempts.
 * - Reports collection is disabled for public reads and writes
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - This ruleset relies on path-based authorization for simplicity and performance.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  N/A - This ruleset does not segregate public vs. private data. All data is private except for "plans" collection
